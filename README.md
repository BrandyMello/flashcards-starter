# FlashCards

# Abstract
Flashcards is a program utilizing the Mocha testing framework and the Chai assertion library for my first Mod 2 project at Turing School of Software and Design to put Test Driven Development into action. Flashcards is a game where the player receives a question and three possible answers. When the player makes the correct choice, the game congratulates them. If the player gets the answer wrong the game encourages the player to try again. Play the game and have some OOP fun!
